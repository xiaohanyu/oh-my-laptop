| Package | Status      | Apt | Homebrew |
|---------+-------------+-----+----------|

| [[http://www.cmake.org/][cmake]]   | Recommended | OK  | OK       |


* clang

Clang is a new competitor for the pervasive, conventional gcc compiler. It
provides some awesome features such as [[http://clang.llvm.org/diagnostics.html][expressive diagnostics]].

I highly recommend trying clang when you has some questions or problems with
your C/Object-C/C++ code.

If you want clang on Mac OS X, you'd better to install [[https://developer.apple.com/xcode/][xcode]]. By the way, many
homebrew packages requires xcode(or its command line tools) as a dependency, so
I recommend you install xcode as soon as possible. Generally, you can get stable
xcode from App Store, and beta version xcode from apple's official site.


* cmake

Cmake is a cross-platform, open-source build system mainly for C/C++
projects. It is used in conjunction with native build environments such as
make, Apple's Xcode, and Microsoft Visual Studio. It has minimal dependencies,
requiring only a C++ compiler on its own build system.

IMHO, cmake is the test choice as a build tool for C/C++, much more better than
traditional =./configure; make; make install=.
