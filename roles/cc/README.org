[[https://cmake.org/][CMake]] is a cross-platform, open-source build system mainly for C/C++ projects.
It is used in conjunction with native build environments such as make, Apple's
Xcode, and Microsoft Visual Studio. It has minimal dependencies, requiring only
a C++ compiler on its own build system.
