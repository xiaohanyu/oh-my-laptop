Cmake is a cross-platform, open-source build system mainly for C/C++
projects. It is used in conjunction with native build environments such as
make, Apple's Xcode, and Microsoft Visual Studio. It has minimal dependencies,
requiring only a C++ compiler on its own build system.

IMHO, cmake is the test choice as a build tool for C/C++, much more better than
traditional =./configure; make; make install=.
