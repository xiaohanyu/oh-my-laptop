* nodenv

Just because I get used to [[https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv][rbenv]], so I choose [[https://github.com/nodenv/nodenv][nodenv]], try to get same workflow
for nodejs. Together, with some official plugins.


* Custom Settings

When you want to run a package from ~npm install~, generally, npm will recommend
you install it by ~npm install -g~, which is globally installation. However,
this may results to a conflict cause npm do not have a similar isolating package
management system like Python's virtualenv or Ruby's bundler.

One trick we can do here is to install all packages locally into ~node_modules~,
and made a shell [[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9679932/how-to-use-package-installed-locally-in-node-module][strick]] by alias ~npm-exec='PATH=$(npm bin):$PATH'~, thus, we can
run local npm executables via ~npm-exec something~.
